# **GALAXY GAME**
### **- Introduction:**
The project that was carried out, was that of a spaceship game, therefore an environment based on space and everything related to it is created, the purpose of the game is to achieve the highest score, with two aids during the game and some difficulty, as the score increases, more enemies will appear with more difficulty to kill.
### **- Controls:**
The ship with which we play, its handling is very simple, for its movement, either up, down, to the side and to the other, and also if we want we can move diagonally, the keys that were used are arrow keys on the keyboard.
The space key was used to shoot.
### **- Enemy:**
**The enemies that we are going to find are:**
a ship, which is called *"ship"*, which is the one that appears at the beginning of the game, which moves from left to right and goes down until it disappears or is eliminated, while it makes its movements it shoots.
The other ship is called* "navy"*, its operation is similar to that of the ship, what changes is that its horizontal displacement is faster and the vertical displacement is slower, it also has a higher level of resistance to the shots than the first ship.
The third ship is called *"ovni"*, this would follow the same behavior of the other two ships with the difference that it is a little more resistant to gunfire, and its horizontal displacement is faster.
Finally, the ship is called *"astro"* and it is the last enemy that appears, its movements are similar, but this enemy stays at the top of the screen and has a higher level than the others to be able to defeat.
All the enemies appear indefinitely until a score is reached and the ships disappear in the same order in which they appeared, until only the *"astro"* ship remains.
### **- Powers:**
**The powers that were implemented were two:**
The first one was symbolized with a shield and this fulfills the objective that when the player's ship touches said shield, it creates a field around the ship and is immune to the enemy's bullets for a short time.
The second power has the ability to eliminate any enemy with a single blow, and this can be achieved by taking the heart symbol.
both powers have a movement related to the mathematical cosine function, varying the distance and speed with which they move downwards.
### **- Menu:**
The menu that was implemented was, that at the moment of starting the game, the player will be able to see, in the name of the game itself, the instructions for handling the ship, and to begin with it tells the user to press any key to start, already inside the game in the upper left corner you will be able to see the number of enemies that have been defeated, and when finished, the highest score in the last games appears, the score that the player had in the recent game and a part that indicates that by pressing any key you can play again.
### **- Description of the levels:**
In this case, it only has four levels, and as mentioned in the part about the enemies, each ship corresponds to a level, with the difference that they appear according to the score, the screen will always be full of enemy ships.
### **- personalization:**
The player's ship can only be moved in the bottom half of the screen.
Already with the interface or the aesthetics, an image was added that moves with the background at the moment the game starts, and when the game is being played, two images were added to complement the background, and at the moment of losing or ending the game, an image appears that says *"game over"*
